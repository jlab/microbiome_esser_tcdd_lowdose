For amplicon sequencing the libraries were prepared following the Illumina 16S Library preparation protocol, amplifying the variable V4 regions of 16S rRNA (FWD: GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA; REV: GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT) and using Illumina TruSeq HT Kits i5 and i7 barcodes. Sequencing was performed in single-end at 285 bp in the Illumina MiSeq using a v2 cassette, 30 percent DNA of PhiX was added to the library to avoid low complexity sequencing issues.
